#### Question 1 - "I Love Lance & Janice"
The premise of this question was quite simple. 
Essentially all you had to do was 'flip' or 'mirror' each lowercase letter in a string along the axis m | n (for example, a => z, t => g). 
Solving this problem just required some simple addition and subtraction. If you know that every lowercase letter has an ASCII value of 96 < ord(c) < 123, 
it can be deduced that the calculation to 'flip' this letter is simply <br/>
(27-(ord(c)-96))+96 => 219-ord(c). and all you need to do at that point is to convert the ASCII value back into a character using chr(n), and add it to the 'translated' string.
